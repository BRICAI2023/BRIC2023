### What is it about?

The human biology is arguably one of the most precious complex systems in existence
that is both multi-scale and highly dynamic in nature. Though a full understanding of such a system
eludes us at the present, modern medicine relies on sophisticated biosensors and data analytics
methods. Generation of actionable insights into health and disease requires an interdisciplinary effort
bringing together domain scientists and technologists.

With the unprecedented growth of available molecular assays (e.g. single cell m’omics, spatial omics,
proteogenomics, and so on) and increasing availability of real world data, there is an essential need
to develop methods and expertise in multi-omics analysis and integration, specially using ML/AI
to bring together prior knowledge, disease biology and clinical data to actionable insights for drug
discovery, diagnostics and prediction of response and resistance to treatments.

In this mini-conference, we will focus on multi-omics technologies and corresponding novel analytics
approaches to help build integrative models of the systems biology in order to understand the healthy
state and transition into a disease state, and how that differs between subgroups of individuals leading
to development of more effective interventions specific to each subgroup.

**Finding disease phenotypes and candidate therapeutics using images: Cell Painting**


**Abstract:**

Cell morphology holds valuable information about the mechanisms and functions of cell structures, and microscopy has been instrumental in uncovering biological phenomena. However, images of cell structures contain more information than what meets the eye. With the advancements in image analysis and deep learning, this rich information can be captured and quantified to drive progress in basic biology research and drug discovery. Image-based profiling using fluorescence microscopy assays such as Cell Painting can reveal the impact of diseases, drugs, and genes on cells, uncover mechanisms of action for small molecules, identify disease-associated phenotypes, detect response to drugs, and predict biological impact and toxicity of compounds, among other applications. This is leading to a growing impact on the pharmaceutical industry as cell morphology becomes a powerful data source for systems biology alongside molecular omics readouts.

**AI for Target Identification and Antibody Discovery**

**Abstract:**

In cancer research, the exploration of innovative strategies for identifying therapeutic targets and developing effective treatments remains paramount. This presentation delves into a novel approach that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize cancer therapeutics. By modeling the intricate landscape of antibody-antigen interactions within the tumor microenvironment, our research strives to uncover new treatments derived from patients' immune systems.

Central to our methodology is the integration of AI, which enables the rational discovery of cancer targets and functional antibodies. As an example, we present a first-in-class antibody drug that exhibits an excellent pre-clinical profile and is currently advancing through clinical trials. Our findings not only shed light on the intricate web of interactions within the tumor microenvironment but also underscore the viability of AI-driven strategies in addressing challenging issues in precision medicine.)

**Talk title:** 

**Annotating cell types and cell states in single-cell omics data: a challenging problem**

**Abstract:**

A first and fundamental task in the analysis of single-cell omics data is annotating the cell type or phenotype of each cell. Though fundamental, this task still poses a bottleneck in the analysis of these data despite the fact that a large number of machine learning based methods have been developed to facilitate this task. Part of the reason for these difficulties is the lack of a standard definition for what constitutes a cell type versus a cell state and a lack of standard nomenclature for cataloging them. In this talk, I will present a mental framework for thinking about cell types versus cell states, how we can catalogue them using ontologies, and how various existing machine learning methods implicitly define the cell type annotation task.

**Pretrained transformers applied to clinical studies improve predictions of treatment efficacy and associated biomarkers**


**Abstract:**
Cancer treatment has made significant advancements in recent decades, leading to improved outcomes and quality of life for many patients. Despite the array of available therapies, including targeted, hormone, and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, many patients experience treatment failure or eventual resistance. Attempts to predict the efficacy of therapies, particularly immuno-oncology therapies, have suffered from limited accuracy and difficulties in identifying molecular and other determinants of response. Improving treatment prediction alone is insufficient to create clinically meaningful research tools; additional prerequisites for this goal involve accommodating small data sets, effectively handling sparse features, integrating diverse clinical data, addressing missing measurements, ensuring interpretability, and extracting valuable biological insights for both clinical context and further research. Multimodal deep-learning models offer a promising avenue to surmount these challenges by leveraging their capacity and flexibility to learn from expansive and varied clinical and molecular data sets. Similar to their application in natural language and other domains, deep-learning models can uncover complex relationships within data that are pertinent to survival and treatment response. In this study, we introduce an explainable transformer-based deep-learning framework that addresses these challenges. This framework yields predictions of survival outcomes, as quantified by concordance index, that surpass the performance of state-of-the-art methods such as Cox proportional hazards, survival random forest, and tumor mutation burden, across diverse independent data sets. We developed the clinical transformer, a deep neural-network survival prediction framework that capitalizes on the flexibility of the deep-learning model, including training strategies like gradual and transfer learning, to maximize the use of available data to enhance survival predictions and generate actionable biological insights. Finally, we illustrate the future potential of the clinical transformer’s generative capability in early-stage clinical studies. By perturbing molecular features associated with immune checkpoint inhibition treatment in immunotherapy-naive patient profiles, we identified a subset of patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. These findings were subsequently validated across three independent immunotherapy treatment cohorts. We anticipate that this research will empower the scientific community to further harness data for the benefit of patients.

**Enabling Efficient Clinical Trials with Generative Models for Clinical Timeseries**

**Abstract:**
Clinical trials typically evaluate the efficacy of an investigational drug or device relative to placebo and/or standard of care. While randomization allows one to estimate the average difference between the treatment and control potential outcomes in the trial population, randomized studies require large numbers of participants to be assigned to a control group, which is both costly and inefficient and often against the wishes of patients themselves. Fortunately, the creation of large databases of individual participant data from historical studies and real world sources makes it possible to train generative models to forecast control potential outcomes for participants in clinical trials—which we call their ‘digital twins’. Participants’ digital twins can be used to create in silico control groups for single arm proof-of-concept studies, or to derive prognostic scores for use as ‘super covariates’ in randomized studies to increase power in ways that are suitable for phase 3 studies as illustrated by the EMA’s qualification opinion for Unlearn’s PROCOVA methodology.

**Multimodal approach to phenotype-guided virtual screening of small molecules**

**Abstract:**
High Content Screening (HCS) is a well-established technology used in the drug discovery process. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence, computer vision, and computational capabilities increase phenotypic screening potential; leveraging the massive amounts of information encoded in multicolor images at single-cell resolution. Our research is centered on the synergistic integration of chemical structures and images from HCS experiments, resulting in a more robust data structure. We demonstrate a substantial performance enhancement achieved through the multimodal approach in diverse applications, including chemical and biological properties prediction, hit identification and virtual screening of molecules that are most likely to induce a phenotype of interest.
